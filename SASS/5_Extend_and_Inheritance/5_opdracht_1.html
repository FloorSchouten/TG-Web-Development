wanneer gebruik je inheritance, wanneer mixins?

Like extend using placeholders, the error mixin isn’t included in the compiled version. 
Unlike extend though, notice how the declarations in the error mixin are repeated multiple times 
in the compiled version? Sheesh. That’s maybe not good?
Then again, this is not exactly what mixins were intended for.
 The true magic in mixins arise from the fact that you can pass in arguments, just like a function call. For our error mixin, we can provide different background colors for different type of errors:
Generally, if you don’t have dynamic styles, using @extend (preferably using placeholders 
— unless you are referencing the class in the DOM) is good enough. Using mixins for static-only 
styles causes unnecessarily bloated stylesheets so it’s a good idea to keep the declarations 
minimal and only for dynamic declarations because it’s going to be duplicated.
A mixin is typically used with multiple inheritance. So, in that sense, there's "no difference".

The detail is that a mixin is rarely useful as a standalone object.

For example, say you have a mixin named "ColorAndDimension", which adds a color property and 
width and height.

Now, you could add ColorAndDimension to a, say, Shape class, a Sprite class, a Car class, etc. 
And they will all have the same interface (say get/setColor, get/setHeight/Width, etc.)

So, in the generic case a mixin IS inheritance. But you can argue it's a matter of the role of 
the class in the overall domain as to whether a mixin is a "primary" class or simply a mixin.
